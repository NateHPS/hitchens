### Bestiarum Geondica

>Dear readers, I have described these beings to the best of my ability. Due to the sensory deficits inherent in Geondic travel, I must trust the words I wrote down in the moment. When I try to elaborate from memory I am stricken with extreme headaches and dizziness. Such is the price of wandering in forbidden realms. Perhaps fellow sojourners of the Spheres Beyond can recognize the creatures I have named here, and supplement further knowledge. -Opal Fernduggle  

Thank you for checking out this crowdsourced bestiary. Using this generator, folks generated random creature names and wrote descriptions for them on Twitter. Descriptions had to fit in one tweet. Each authorâ€™s twitter handle is included after each description.
