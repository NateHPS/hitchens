### Bestiarum Geondica

>Dear readers, I have described these beings to the best of my ability. Due to the sensory deficits inherent in Geondic travel, I must trust the words I wrote down in the moment. When I try to elaborate from memory I am stricken with extreme headaches and dizziness. Such is the price of wandering in forbidden realms. Perhaps fellow sojourners of the Spheres Beyond can recognize the creatures I have named here, and supplement further knowledge. -Opal Fernduggle  

Bestiarum Geondica is a crowdsourced bestiary. Using [this generator](https://perchance.org/bestiary), folks generated random creature names and wrote descriptions for them on Twitter. Descriptions had to fit in one tweet. The zine includes the generator as a 3d66 random table and 100 creature descriptions from Twitter.
